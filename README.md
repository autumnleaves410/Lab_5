For my case 1, I couldn't get the characters to display. Probably a JSON formatting error. 
I think I need to make new async methods in order for it to work. 
--Update--
Finally fixed the methods. I just needed to edit my character class, etc. Everything is functioning
correctly including the urls, jsons, etc.

New problem..
I'm trying to get it to display character, vision, weapon, rarity, and description. 
For some reason, it won't display. Perhaps theres an issue with the file path
--UPDATE--
FINALLY WORKED. Literally, I just needed to match the json keys...

Case 1 Complete.

Had a problem requesting the API for the archives. Turns out it was just a typo
and i didnt request it properly.
